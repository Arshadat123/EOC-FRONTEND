            <p>Extended reality lab in the Skill Orientation Centre for Engineering (SOCE),
                CUSAT as its extension proposed by Prof(Dr.) Sasi Gopalan, Department of mathematics
                ( Mentor & Coordinator SOCE) aims at prototyping human interaction to make the future more
                better and human centred by creating advancements in computer vision, augmented reality and
                virtual reality. The advancements in this field indicate that the XR lab will be the next pervasive
                platform for communication, experimentation, and work via the replacement of current hardware into a
                Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed reality Library.</p>
